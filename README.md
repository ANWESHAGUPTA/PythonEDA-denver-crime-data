## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Analysis**: Our analysis dives deep into the 2021 crime statistics for Denver City, aiming to identify recurring crime patterns across different categories and geographical areas.

- **COVID-19 and MeToo Impact**: We investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic and the MeToo movement have influenced the occurrence of various crimes, unveiling insights into their correlations.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Adaboost classifier, we predict the likelihood of potential crimes based on real-time location data, aiding law enforcement in proactive measures.

## Key Steps and Methods

1. **Data Collection**: We gathered comprehensive crime statistics data for Denver City in the year 2021 from reliable sources.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Employing data visualization and statistical analysis, we identified recurring crime patterns, seasonal trends, and potential influencing factors.

3. **COVID-19 and MeToo Analysis**: We examined how crime rates have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the societal impact of the MeToo movement, providing valuable insights into changing crime dynamics.

4. **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing the Adaboost classifier machine learning model, we trained the algorithm on historical crime data to predict the likelihood of specific crimes occurring in real-time locations.

## Results and Implications

- Our exploratory analysis revealed recurring patterns in crime, offering insights that could assist law enforcement agencies in allocating resources effectively.

- The analysis of COVID-19 and MeToo movement impact shed light on the interconnectedness between societal events and crime rates, guiding proactive measures.

- The predictive modeling using the Adaboost classifier can aid law enforcement in anticipating potential crime hotspots and taking preventive actions.

## Future Developments

In the future, we plan to:

- Refine predictive models to account for more contextual features and achieve higher accuracy.

- Collaborate with law enforcement agencies to implement real-time crime prevention strategies.
